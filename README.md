## Technologies Used

1.HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It provides a set of elements and attributes that define the semantics of a document.

2.Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing custom CSS. It allows for rapid styling and prototyping by applying pre-defined classes directly in the HTML markup.

Creating this project has been a great learning experience for me as a beginner. Tailwind CSS into this project significantly enhanced my understanding of modern CSS practices. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach allowed me to quickly style and layout components without writing custom CSS, enabling a more efficient development workflow. Learning to use Tailwind CSS taught me how to leverage utility classes to achieve responsive designs and consistent styling across different screen sizes. Overall, working with Tailwind CSS has been instrumental in improving my proficiency in frontend development and building user-friendly interfaces.
